ProjectName: 2048bot
Team name: 404_DNE
Team members:	Ruijun Shen (Java programmer)
		Yihui Wang (python programmer) 
		Yunyang Lu (Program manager, python programmer)
HackED 2023

Included Files (Required for Running):
	2048_data (file with image sample of numbers)
	KeyCtrl.py
	ScrShotTaker.py
	TemplateMatch.py
	imageSplit.py
	main.py
	pre_orb.py
	manager.jar
	template2048.png

Included Files (source file)
	manager.java (source file of manager.jar)
	
	gameManager.java
	board.java
	simulateBoard.java
	(above 3 are standalone trainning and testing file for the 
		movement decision bot. The result combined into manager.java)


Introduction:
		This program is a AI bot for the 2048 game, with usage of 
	openCV as an image processor for recognizing position and value 
	of the numbers(based on python), and an AI bot which decide the next
	movement(based on Java)
		The program is currently working to some degree, video 
	demostration is included.  

Usage:
	Running main.py with python3 or any IDE with python3 environment 
	, and packages specified in requirement.txt
	for packages installing, use:
		pip install -r requirement.txt

	The program will pop out the 2048.org website, and start playing it. 
	Close the program directly to terminate it.
	
WARNING: This program will take screenshots for image processing. 
	The screenshots will be ONLY stored locally in /Scr folder.

Outcome:
		This project is working with minor image detection error for 
	future development. The stand-alone Java Manager.java works well in 
	solving the cli 2048 game. The python image detection part reveals
	some detection confusion (espectially in seperating 16 and 64).
		This project is a good practice for combinning programming in 
	different language (Java and Python), project managing among multiple 
	contributors with different programming languages is practiced.
